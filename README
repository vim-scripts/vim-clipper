vim-clipper provides integration between Vim and Clipper
(https://github.com/wincent/clipper), which is an OS X "launch agent" that
runs in the background providing a service that exposes the local clipboard to
tmux sessions and other processes running both locally and remotely.

Specifically, vim-clipper provides a |:Clip| command, to send the last-yanked
text to Clipper, and it sets up a <leader>y mapping that calls |:Clip|.
